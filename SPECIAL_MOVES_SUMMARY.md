## **🔧 Technical Implementation**

### **Castling Logic**:

canCastle(board, kingX, kingY, color, side) {
  // Check all requirements
}

// Execution
if (moveData.isCastling) {
  // Move king and rook together
}
```

### **En Passant Logic**:
```javascript
// Detection
if (this.enPassantTarget) {
  // Check if en passant is possible
}

// Execution
if (moveData.isEnPassant) {
  // Capture opponent pawn
}
```

### **Promotion Logic**:
```javascript
// Detection
if (piece[0].toUpperCase() === 'P' && 
    ((piece[1] === 'w' && toRow === 0) || 
     (piece[1] === 'b' && toRow === 7))) {
  // Show promotion modal
}
```
